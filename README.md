Autism is a developmental disorder comprise a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention.

The "Emotion Recognition in Autism using Convolutional Neural Networks" project aims to develop an advanced and accurate model for recognizing emotions in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Emotion recognition is a crucial aspect of social interaction and communication, and individuals with ASD often face challenges in understanding and expressing emotions, which can impact their overall quality of life.

The outcome of this project will be a robust and accurate emotion recognition model specifically designed for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The model can serve as a valuable tool to enhance their emotional communication skills and facilitate better social interactions. Furthermore, the project contributes to the growing field of AI-driven healthcare applications aimed at improving the lives of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.

Results

-Lack of customization: The unique emotional expressions and requirements of people with ASD may not be able to be met by the current methods without adaptation. 
-Accuracy: Systems for recognizing emotions could have trouble identifying the subtle emotional clues that people with ASD frequently display. 
-Insufficient educational elements: The educational components necessary to teach people with ASD about emotions could not be present in these systems.
